# Deep Learning Library From Scratch
I am now an experienced programmer, and I acknowledge that the code here is messy and goes against all the best programming practices. However, it still holds a special place in my heart since it was my first programming personal project.

I was a Mathematics and Statistics major who understood the math behind Deep Learning, but I had almost 0 programming experience. I learned Python by doing this project.

The code has been mathematically optimized (my linear algebra courses were beneficial), and the neural networks can run on CPUs and GPUs.
