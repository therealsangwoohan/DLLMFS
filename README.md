# Deep Learning Library From Scratch
I am now an experienced programmer and I aknowledge the code here is messy and goes against all the best programming practices. However, it still holds a special place in my heart since it was my first programming personal project.

I was a Mathematics and Statistics major who understood the math behind Deep Learning, but I had almost 0 programming experience.I litterally learned Python by doing this project.

The code has been mathematically optimized (my linear algebra courses were very useful) and the neural networks can run on CPUs, GPUs, and the cloud.
