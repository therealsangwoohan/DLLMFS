# DLLMFS
DLLMFS stands for Deep Learning Library Made From Scratch and by scratch, I mean by array programming without importing any machine learning functions that wasn't made by me.

The project started on Matlab, since it was the only programming language I knew 3 months ago. 

After that, I learned OOP with Python and Numpy to create a class to easily compare multiple deep learning models. 

Later, when I learned about how GPUs are essential for parallel computing, I replaced every numpy arrays to torch gpu tensors. 

Right now, training a Neural Network with Cross-Entropy and Gradient Descent using my library is just as fast as Tensorflow and Pytorch.
